# sentiment-analysis-reviews
This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze product reviews and classify them as positive or negative. It explores machine learning and deep learning approaches to improve sentiment detection. The final model provides accurate predictions and supports real-time sentiment analysis.
This project deals with sentiment analysis of Amazon Alexa product reviews, aiming to classify them into positive or negative.

We built a complete pipeline that included cleaning the text, handling emojis, removing stopwords, lemmatization, and converting the data into numerical form.
To handle the imbalance in the dataset, both oversampling and undersampling techniques were applied.
Several models were tested, including SVM, Random Forest, and BiLSTM.
Among them, BiLSTM achieved the best accuracy, showing strong performance in understanding context, informal writing, and emojis.
Finally, the system was tested with real-time predictions, making it a useful tool for analyzing customer feedback.
